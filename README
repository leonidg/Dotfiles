These are some common dotfiles I use. Each references a site-specific
file (the standard filename followed by a "_local",
e.g. ".bashrc_local") which you can put in things that only belong on
some machines. This is a pretty simplistic setup, but I don't
administer many machines so it works well enough.

Included files:
---------------
  * bashrc
        ~/.bashrc, GNU Bourne Again Shell
        http://www.gnu.org/software/bash/
  * screenrc
        ~/.screenrc, GNU Screen
        http://www.gnu.org/software/screen/
  * emacs
        ~/.emacs, GNU Emacs
        http://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/
  * owl-startup
